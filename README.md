React JS Assignment: Country, State, and  City Management Application 

Project Overview 

The goal of this project is to build a Country, State, and City Management system  using ReactJS and JavaScript (without using any external libraries or npm packages).  The application allows users to add, edit, and delete countries, states, and cities in a  hierarchical structure. 

The core requirements include:

1. Country Management: Add, Edit, Delete countries. 
2. State Management: Add, Edit, Delete states for a specific country. 3. City Management: Add, Edit, Delete cities within a specific state. 4. Confirmation Dialogs: Show confirmation alerts before performing delete and  update actions. 

Functional Requirements 

1. Country Management 

• Add a Country: 
o The user should be able to add a new country using a button to trigger a  prompt. 
o Initially, the user can add a country without specifying any states. • Edit a Country: 
o The user should be able to edit an existing country name by triggering an  edit option from the UI. 
o A confirmation dialog should appear before updating a country. • Delete a Country: 
o The user should be able to delete a country. 
o When a country is deleted, its associated states and cities should also be  deleted. 
o A confirmation alert should appear before deleting a country.

2. State Management 

• Add a State: 
o States can be added to a specific country. 
o The user can choose to add the state now or add it later (via an "edit"  flow). 
o States should be linked to a specific country. 
• Edit a State: 
o The user should be able to edit the name of an existing state. 
o A confirmation dialog should appear before updating a state. 
• Delete a State: 
o The user should be able to delete a state. 
o Deleting a state should remove all associated cities. 
o A confirmation dialog should appear before deleting a state. 

3. City Management 

• Add a City: 
o Cities can be added under a specific state. 
o The user can add a city either during the state creation process or later via  an "edit" flow. 
• Delete a City: 
o The user should be able to delete a city under a specific state. 
o A confirmation alert should appear before deleting a city. 
User Interface (UI) Design 
The application consists of the following UI components: 

1. Main Screen: 

a. A button to add a new country. 
b. A list of existing countries, each with options to:  
i. Edit the country name. 
ii. Delete the country. 
iii. View and manage states for the country.

2. State Management Screen: 

a. For each country, a section where the user can:  
i. Add a new state. 
ii. Edit existing states. 
iii. Delete states (with confirmation).

3. City Management Screen: 

a. For each state, a section where the user can:  
i. Add a new city. 
ii. Delete existing cities (with confirmation). 
Component Breakdown 

1. App.js 

• Role: Main component responsible for managing the overall state of countries,  states, and cities. 
• Key Features: 
o Manages the state of the countries. 
o Handles the logic for adding, updating, and deleting countries. o Passes down data and functions to child components for states and  cities management.

2. CountryList.js 

• Role: Displays a list of all countries. 
• Key Features: 
o Allows the user to add a new country. 
o Allows the user to edit or delete a country. 
o Displays a list of states for each country and provides a link to manage  those states. 

3. StateList.js 

• Role: Displays a list of states for a specific country. 
• Key Features: 
o Allows the user to add, edit, and delete states. 
o Shows a confirmation dialog before performing delete or update actions. o Displays a list of cities for each state and provides a link to manage those  cities. 

4. CityList.js 

• Role: Displays a list of cities for a specific state. 
• Key Features: 
o Allows the user to add or delete cities.
o Shows a confirmation dialog before performing delete actions. 
Business Logic 
Adding New Entities: 
• When adding a new entity (country, state, or city), the user will be prompted to  enter a name (via a simple prompt or a form-based UI). 
• The new entity is then added to the existing data structure and rendered in the  UI. 
Editing Existing Entities: 
• Editing involves replacing the name of an existing country, state, or city. • A confirmation dialog is shown before proceeding with the update. • After confirming, the name is updated in the data structure, and the UI is re rendered. 
Deleting Entities: 
• Deleting an entity (country, state, or city) triggers a confirmation dialog. • If confirmed, the entity is removed from the data structure, and all related  states/cities (in case of deleting a country or state) are also removed. • The UI is updated to reflect the changes. 
Confirmation Alerts: 
For critical actions such as updating or deleting a country, state, or city, a confirmation  alert is shown: 
1. Before Deleting: A simple window.confirm() is used to confirm the user's  intention. 
2. Before Editing: A prompt is used to ask the user for the new name, followed by a  confirmation step.
Implementation Details: 
Technologies Used: 
• ReactJS: For building the component-based user interface. 
• JavaScript (ES6): For handling state management, event handling, and data  manipulation. 
Development Flow: 
1. Set up React App: Use Create React App to initialize the project. 2. Create Components: Develop individual components for countries, states, and  cities. 
3. State Management: Use React's useState hook to manage the state of the  countries, states, and cities. 
4. Data Flow: Pass data and functions down the component hierarchy using props. 5. User Interaction: Use prompt dialogs for adding and editing names, and confirm  dialogs for deletion. 
Testing and Validation: 
1. Functional Testing: 
a. Add, edit, and delete operations are tested to ensure proper functionality. b. Confirmation dialogs appear and work as expected. 
2. UI Testing: 
a. Ensure that the UI properly reflects the changes after any operation (add,  edit, delete). 
b. Verify that the hierarchical structure (Country → State → City) is correctly  displayed and managed. 
Conclusion: 
This application allows users to manage a hierarchical structure of countries, states,  and cities, with the ability to add, edit, and delete each level. The flow is simple and 
intuitive, with proper confirmation dialogs to ensure that users do not accidentally  perform destructive actions. 
By following this structure, you can ensure the application is scalable, maintainable,  and adheres to the specified requirements.
